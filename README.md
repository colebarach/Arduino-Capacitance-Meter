# Arduino-Capacitance-Meter
A capacitance meter designed for the arduino microcontroller
## Usage
Connect a capacitor in series with a resistor to form a RC circuit. The input to this circuit will be the charge and discharge pins, and the voltage will be monitored via the comparator pin. The capacitance will be calculated automatically and averaged over time.
## Notes
This circuit is not designed for accuracy, but to provide a method of measuring capacitance when higher level tools are not available. This code is designed mainly for personally use.
